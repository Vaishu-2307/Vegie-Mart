               <p>The AGM, run by the Royal Horticultural Society, is the older scheme, set up in 1922. It received a complete overhaul in 1992 when a new list of 3,600 plants was drawn up. New awards are made every year, but the list is now reviewed periodically, to ensure that every variety is still available, hasn't developed disease or pest problems, and hasn't been superseded by something better. In the 2012 review, for example, the crab apple 'Comtessa de Paris' replaced 'Golden Hornet', which can suffer scab.
